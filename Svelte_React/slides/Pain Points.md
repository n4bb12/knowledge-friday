# ðŸ¤• Pain Points

- Emitting events seems complicated
- Unnatural `x = x` workaround for object mutations
- Default imports vs. refactoring file names
- Auto-import and linting somtimes confused about instance vs module context
- No styled-jsx-like style expressions
- Explicit build dependencies and config, no managed upgrade path
